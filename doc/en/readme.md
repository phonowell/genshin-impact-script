This is a Genshin Impact script that includes automatic fishing, automatic
picking up, combat assistance, and other functions. It is developed based on
`coffee-ahk`, which is small in size and low in occupancy. The functions are
realized through image recognition, without any memory reading or writing or
network packet modification. **This script does not include any cheating
functions.**
