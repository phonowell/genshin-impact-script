This is a Genshin Impact script that includes automatic fishing, automatic
pickup, combat assistance, and other functions. It is developed based on
`coffee-ahk`, which is small in size and low in occupancy. The functions are
realized by image recognition, without reading or writing memory or modifying
network packets. **This script does not contain any cheating functions.**
